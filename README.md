# Lab 5 exercise for CMPINF_0010 
This program asks you for your name, and then asks you if you'd like to run function 1, 2, or 3. Function 1 asks for the lengths of two legs of a triangle and calculates the length of the third leg using the Pythagorean Theorem. Function 2 prints the name of the user backwards. Function three returns the user's number square rooted plus 1000. Contributors: Jeremy Romano, Isaac Bredbenner, Kameron Langford
